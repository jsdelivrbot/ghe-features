# GitHub Enterprise Features

Can I use the feature on GitHub Enterprise?

## How it works

We're not able to know on The GitHub Blog whether we can use features which shipped on GitHub.com
on [GitHub Enterprise][github-enterprise].

It's the roll up [New Features][blog] at The GitHub Blog for GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise. And
it shows the shipped GitHub Enterprise version in The GitHub Blog posts.

## Shipped features list

Try to check [ghe-features.json](ghe-features.json).

## Older than v11.10.341

Few use them and it's difficult to investigate the old versions.

## Contributing

Patch welcome.
